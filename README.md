#Project 1: ModifiedGoogleDemoScene 

**Name:** Rich Barr

**Time to complete project:** 20 hours (approx)

**Enjoyed:** Experimenting with the particle effects engine and physics materials (bounciness), modifying different parameters and observing the results 

**Challenging:** I spent a long time trying to work out how to change the gaze pointer from a cardboard trigger mechanism to gaze and select. The intention was to destroy the cube just by looking at it after a predetermined length of time. I found that by adding code to the `Teleport.cs` script I could make the cube teleport instantly just by looking at it, but it would not invoke the `GvrReticle.cs` script (and it wouldn't work with the buttons either) so I abandoned this idea. Hopefully I'll learn how to do this further along in the course. 

Please note that I've included the GoogleVR folder because of changes made to the `Teleport.cs` script.
